# üåê Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Associate (DP-100) Professional Certificate

## Overview

The **Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Associate (DP-100) Professional Certificate** prepared me to implement and run machine learning workloads on Azure, enhancing my data science expertise through real-world applications in cloud computing and machine learning. Developed by Microsoft, this program taught me essential skills in data science and machine learning deployment on Azure.

Data science on Azure combines the power of machine learning with scalable cloud infrastructure. With this certificate, I gained the skills to create, manage, and deploy ethical machine learning solutions within the Azure ecosystem.

## üöÄ Skills and Benefits Gained

- **Azure Resource Management**: Acquired skills in managing and configuring Azure resources specifically for machine learning.
- **Model Training and Experimentation**: Practiced running experiments and training machine learning models directly on Azure.
- **Ethical and Responsible AI**: Gained a strong foundation in deploying responsible AI solutions, ensuring models are fair, transparent, and reliable.
- **Azure Databricks**: Hands-on experience using Databricks for data exploration and model building, integrated with Azure Machine Learning.
- **End-to-End ML Deployment**: Developed the ability to operationalize ML models, preparing me for real-world data science deployment in the cloud.

The program consists of 5 specialized courses:

1. **Create Machine Learning Models in Microsoft Azure**
2. **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning for Data Scientists**
3. **Build and Operate Machine Learning Solutions with Azure**
4. **Perform Data Science with Azure Databricks**
5. **Prepare for DP-100: Data Science on Microsoft Azure Exam**

## üìö Learning Materials & Timeframe

The course offered a blend of:

- Video lectures and in-depth readings
- Interactive practice exercises and quizzes
